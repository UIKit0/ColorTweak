ColorTweak
==========

A simple app to test various blurring and color combinations for image thumbs. 

If you want to use your own images, just replace the jpg files 1.jpg ... 25.jpg with your own. The size of the image is 112 x 112 points.

If you just want to checkout the project, download, open in Xcode, and build to iPad and it'll work. I'm still working on implementing the color picker, but otherwise it works very well (and passes a default blackColor as the color tint).
